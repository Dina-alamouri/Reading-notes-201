## HTML & CSS Design 

 according to book ..

1- **HTML**
 We will spend the first chapter looking at how HTML is used to create web pages. You will see that you start by writing down the words you want to appear on your page. You then add tags or elements to the words so that the browser knows what is a heading, where a paragraph begins and ends, and so on.
2- **CSS**
 We start this section with a chapter that explains how CSS uses rules to enable you to control the styling and layout of web pages. We then go on to look at the wide variety of CSS properties you can use in your CSS rules.
3-**Practical**
 We end up with some helpful information that will assist you in building better websites.

*When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.* 

## How Websites Are Created??
All websites use HTML and CSS, but content 
management systems, blogging software, and 
e-commerce platforms often add a few more 
technologies into the mix.

How it is Created
Small websites are often written 
just using HTML and CSS.
Larger websites — in particular 
those that are updated regularly 
and use a content management 
system (CMS), blogging tools, or 
e-commerce software — often 
make use of more complex 
technologies on the web server, 
but these technologies are 
actually used to produce HTML 
and CSS that is then sent to the 
browser. So, if your site uses 
these technologies, you will be 
able to use your new HTML and 
CSS knowledge to take more 
control over how your site looks.
Larger, more complex sites like 
these may use a database to 
store data, and programming 
languages such as PHP, ASP.Net, 
Java, or Ruby on the web server, 
but you do not need to know 
these technologies to improve 
what the user sees. The skills 
you'll learn in this book should be 
enough to help you on that road.

## HTML Describesthe Structure of Pages##

In the browser window you can see a web page that features exactly 
the same content as the Word document you met on the page 18. To 
describe the structure of a web page, we add code to the words we want 
to appear on the page

<body>
You met the <body> element 
in the first example we created. 
Everything inside this element is 
shown inside the main browser 
window.
<head>
Before the <body> element you 
will often see a <head> element. 
This contains information 
about the page (rather than 
information that is shown within 
the main part of the browser 
window that is highlighted in 
blue on the opposite page). 
You will usually find a <title>
element inside the <head>
element.
<title>
The contents of the <title>
element are either shown in the 
top of the browser, above where 
you usually type in the URL of 
the page you want to visit, or 
on the tab for that page (if your 
browser uses tabs to allow you 
to view multiple pages at the 
same time)


## summary
X HTML pages are text documents.
X HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled 
brackets) to give the information they surround special 
meaning.
X Tags are often referred to as elements.
X Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes 
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes 
the end.
X Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more 
about the content of that element.
X Attributes require a name and a value.
X To learn HTML you need to know what tags are 
available for you to use, what they do, and where they 
can go.

## java
before you learn how to read and write the JavaScript language itself, you need to become familiar with some key concepts in computer programming. They will be covered in three sections:

A : What is a script and how do I create one? A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it.
B : How do computers fit in with the world around them? [COMPUTERS CREATE MODELS OF THE WORLD USING DATA. OBJECTS (THINGS) In computer programming, each physica l thing in the world can be represented as an object. Each object can have its own: • Properties • Events • Methods Events : There are common ways in which people interact with each type of object. For example, in a car a driver will typically use at least two pedals. The car has been designed to respond differently when the driver interacts with each of the different pedals: • The accelerator makes the car go faster • The brake slows it down , Similarly, programs are designed to do different things when users interact with the computer in different ways. For example, clicking on a contact link on a web page could bring up a contact form, and entering text into a search box may automatically trigger the search functionality.]
C : How do I write a script for a web page? It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension. The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like the element can be used to load a CSS file). If you view the source code of the page in the browser, the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML, because the script works with the model of the web page that the browser has created.

Interactive Front-End Web Development

EXAMPLES OF JAVASCRIPT IN THE BROWSER Being able to change the content of an HTML page while it is loaded in the browser is very powerful.

SLIDESHOWS : Slideshows can display a number of different images (or other HTML content) within the same space on a given page. They can play automatically as a sequence, or users can click through the slides manually. They allow more content to be displayed within a limited amount of space.
FORMS : Validating forms (checking whether they have been filled in correctly) is important when information is supplied by users. JavaScript lets you alert the user if mistakes have been made. It can also perform sophisticated calculations based on any data entered and reveal the results to the user.
